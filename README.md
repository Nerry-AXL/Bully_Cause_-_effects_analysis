## README: Teachers’ Perceptions on the Causes and Effects of Bullying in Public Primary Schools

### Project Overview

This project investigates teachers' perceptions regarding the causes and effects of bullying in public primary schools within Oke Ero Local Government, Kwara State. The primary aim is to understand teachers' awareness and attitudes toward bullying and to identify potential areas for improvement in handling and preventing bullying incidents. The data collected from teachers was analyzed using Python (3.11.5), providing insights into their perceptions and approaches.

### Data Overview

The dataset comprises responses from 30 teachers, including both class and subject teachers. A total of 18 survey questions (Q1 to Q18) were designed to assess teachers' perceptions of bullying, its causes, effects, and their approaches to managing such incidents.

### Descriptive Statistics

The descriptive statistics for the survey responses include:

- **Count**: The total number of responses for each question (30, indicating no missing values).
- **Mean**: The average score for each question, reflecting overall perceptions.
- **Standard Deviation (std)**: A measure of variability in responses; a higher value indicates more diverse opinions.
- **Min/Max**: The lowest and highest scores given by respondents for each question.
- **Quartiles**: The 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles, providing insights into the distribution of responses.

The statistics reveal trends in teachers' perceptions regarding bullying, highlighting areas of strong agreement or disagreement.

### Research Questions

Three research questions were formulated to guide the analysis:

1. **What are the teachers’ perceptions on the causes of bullying?**
   - The analysis of Q1 to Q9 indicates high perceptions of factors such as peer influence and family issues as significant causes of bullying.

2. **What are the teachers’ perceptions on the effects of bullying?**
   - Responses to Q10 to Q18 show a strong recognition of the emotional and academic impacts of bullying, with several factors rated highly.

3. **What is the teachers’ approach to handling bullying?**
   - The analysis of Q7 and Q9 indicates a moderate level of proactive measures taken by teachers in addressing bullying incidents, although some areas require improvement.

### Summary of Findings

- **Causes of Bullying**: Teachers identified various factors contributing to bullying, with high agreement on peer influence and family issues.
- **Effects of Bullying**: The emotional and academic consequences of bullying were well recognized by teachers.
- **Handling Bullying**: While teachers demonstrated a moderate approach to managing bullying, there is a clear need for enhanced training and guidelines.

### Conclusion

The findings underscore the importance of addressing bullying in public primary schools and highlight the need for improved strategies and training for teachers. By understanding teachers' perceptions, this study aims to contribute to the development of effective interventions to combat bullying in educational settings.

### Code and Analysis

The analysis was conducted using Python, and the code includes:

- **Data Loading**: Importing the dataset and libraries.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculating and displaying key statistics for each survey question.
- **Visualization**: Generating plots to illustrate the distribution of responses and key findings.

### Usage

To run the analysis, ensure you have Python 3.11.5 installed along with the necessary libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib). Clone this repository and execute the Jupyter notebook to view the results and visualizations.
